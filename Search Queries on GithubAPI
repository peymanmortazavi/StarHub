Retrieving search results, repositories having more than 5 stars:

https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>=5

Default number of repositories displayed per page is 30.
If you want to set the number of repositories to be displayed on a page then you do something like this:

https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>=5&page=3&per_page=100

At the max, you can only display 100 repositories per a page. => only 10 pages can be retrieved as the limit is 1000 results per an API request.

If you want to search for repositories created on a date:

https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:=2016-01-01&stars:>=5&page=1&per_page=100
